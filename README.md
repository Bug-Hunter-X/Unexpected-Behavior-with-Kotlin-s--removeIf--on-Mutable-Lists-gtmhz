This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Kotlin involving the use of the `removeIf` function on mutable lists.  The `BuggyRemoveIf.kt` file shows the erroneous code, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The `FixedRemoveIf.kt` provides the corrected approach, illustrating safe removal of elements from a mutable list.  This example highlights the importance of careful list manipulation when dealing with in-place modifications during iteration. The bug arises from modifying the list while iterating over it using the `removeIf` function. This can lead to skipping elements or throwing an exception depending on the implementation.
